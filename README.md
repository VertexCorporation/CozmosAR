# Cozmos
### A New Layer of Reality

Cozmos is a next-generation virtual reality platform designed to extend human interaction, education, and digital existence beyond physical boundaries.

Our goal is to make it possible to experience real-world activities inside a fully virtual universe with a level of presence close to reality itself.

## What is Cozmos?

Cozmos is a fully virtual VR world where users can:

- Meet and interact with other real people
- Attend lessons and educational experiences without physical presence
- Communicate naturally, as if being there in real life
- Play, explore, and share persistent virtual environments
- Exist inside a living, evolving digital world

Cozmos is not just a game.  
It is a new reality layer built on top of the physical one.

## Vision

**A New Layer of Reality**

We believe reality does not end with the physical world.  
Cozmos aims to create a new layer where:

- You don’t need to go somewhere to *be* there
- You don’t need a physical classroom to *learn*
- You don’t need physical distance to *connect*

Cozmos is designed to make presence independent of location.
